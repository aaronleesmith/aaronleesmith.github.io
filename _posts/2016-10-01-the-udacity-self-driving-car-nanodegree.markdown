Well, I'm in it now.

Over the past 2 years I have been feverishly working towards a coveted Master's Degree in Computer Science from The Georgia Institute of Technology. It's been season after season of pedal to the metal work without more than 3 weeks break to finish by the end of this year.

As I started to imagine life after school, I envisioned taking a long break and focusing on my work in Data Science and Machine Learning. In September I got an email inviting me to apply for a spot in the new Udacity SDCND. Since taking the wonderfully stimulating [Artificial Intelligence for Robotics](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-8803-artificial-intelligence-robotics) I have had a ear to the ground for opporotunities in the autonomous vehicle space. This was that opportunity.

I applied on a whim, and accepted the offer to join the first cohort (October, 2016) to begin the 9 month parter-paired program.

As part of the ongoing effort to get a foothold on this craft, I will be updating blog posts pertaining to the program, the challenges, and the assignments. 

As excited as I am about the prospect of completing my degree and taking a rest, I am more excited to begin to put the last two years to the test on a new, cutting-edge, challenging area of science. Whether it's simple lane detection, using deep neural networks to detect street signs, or learning to work with control mechanisms, there's no doubt the next year will be fast-paced and fun.

Sure, they say 10 hours a week. My guess is that this isn't enough time to really dig in a grasp the material. In OMSCS I have been consistently pulling upwards of 30 hours a week studying, doing projects, and helping my classmates. Whatever the time commitment, it will be worth it for the experience and the knowledge. And hey, robot cars!

OMG, robot cars.
