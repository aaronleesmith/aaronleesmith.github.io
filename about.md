# What in the world is "Flippidy bits?"
During my undergraduate coursework in computer science I took a wonderful class introducing students to the world of logic gates, mathematics in multiple base systems (especially binary and hexadecimal), circuit design, and general computer architecture. I remember fondly spending hours and hours completing the big class project: designing a working digital lock using circuit diagramming software. As my interest in CS blossomed from an interest in programming to interests in *so much more*, I was enamored with the content at hand.

The professor would often get frsutrated with students as they tried to wrap their heads around thinking in binary. He used to tell us, "you've got to **flip the bits**" when we would present incorrect responses. When you're wrong in a computer, you've got to flip the bits. Physical machines abstract away direct electrical signals. CISC instruction set chips abstract away very low level instructions. Low and then high level programming languages abstract away complicated error-prone assembely code, and user interfaces abstract away the terminal. In the end, it's all *bits*. When things go wrong, you've got to flip 'em.

# Me
My name is Aaron Smith. I am a Georgia Tech alumnus and data scientist. I really care about this stuff. I really, really care about the issues of the day, especially as they pertain to technology: climate change, autonomy, fake news, wealth inequality, general artifical intelligence. Fundamentally my goal is to leverage whatever skills I can to help save or improve people's lives. Lately this has meant investing time and money studying autonomous vehicle technology so I can properly offer value to a team to help reduce traffic fatalities by contributing to any part of a self-driving car pipeline.
