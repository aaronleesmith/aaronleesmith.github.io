There's so many things I want to explore, none of them see the light of day.  While I work on fixing this problem, here's a shortlist of research I would like to do / posts I would like to write.

**Autonomous Driving**

* Model Predictive Control & PID Control
* Deep dive into the math of Kalman Filters & state estimation.
* Localization with particle fitlers, an exploration of monte carlo methods.
* 4 ways to drive around a track: comparing CNN, Kalman, PID, and MPC.
* Advanced lane finding: exploring the current state of research in the area relating to computer vision methodologies.

**Statistics & Mathematics**

* Mathematical paradoxes
* Baye's rule deep dive
* Thinking about matrices -- distillation of the great 3Brown1Blue course on linear algebra.

**Programming**

* Numpy / pandas -- avoiding loops.
* Examples of data exporation and feature extraction in Python and R.
* Analysis of some Kaggle kernels. What do the winners do?
