title: OMSCS Retrospective
---
_I'm Aaron Smith. I graduated from the Georgia Tech Master's of Computer Science program in December, 2016._

Two years have come and come since I began my Master's degree journey, wide-eyed and full of excitement. In fact, each subsequent semester found me eager for the content and challenge that was to follow. Now that it's all done and grades are in, I wanted to share my thoughts on the program as a whole, my experience with individual courses and professors, and my takeaway from the whole thing.

# Hello, OMSCS
OMSCS, short for "Online Master of Science in Computer Science" began its first semester in Fall of 2014. I considered applying at the time, but decided to wait until the following Spring. In the meantime, I addressed some lingering questions I had about the program. What was the time commitment (I am working full time), how rigorous was the program, and was this your typical online degree?

What I meant by "typical" was is this a watered down version of the content. As an aside, I have always qualified this program when people ask me where I go to school. Living in San Diego, when I say "Georgia Tech" it's always followed with an explanation that the online program is just as rigorous as the in-person program. While I can verify this first-hand, I can say that the online program was exceptionally challenging, and I personally do not think any qualification is needed. In fact, Georgia Tech agrees; the diploma is identical.

# Courses taken over my 6 semesters
* Machine Learning (A)
* Computer Networks (B)
* Computational Photography (A)
* Machine Learning for Trading (A)
* Computer Vision (A)
* Reinforcement Learning (A)
* Artificial Intelligence for Robotics (emphasis on self-driving cars) (A)
* Software Architecture and Design (A)
* Data and Visual Analytics (A)
* Complexity, Computability, and Algorithms (B)

# Machine Learning
My specialty was Machine Learning (although I also took enough classes to satisfy the Artificial Intelligence specialty as well -- they only let you choose one). The classes that directly impacted this field of study were Machine Learning, Machine Learning for Trading, Reinforcement Learning, and Data and Visual Analytics.

These courses were all fantastic in their own ways. First and foremost, Professors [Charles Isbell](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/Charles.Isbell/) and [Michael Littman](http://cs.brown.edu/~mlittman/) have made some amazing contributions to the OMSCS pedagogy. Their Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning lectures are enjoying to listen to, easy to follow, and cover a broad range of topics. I can say right now that their classes were the most approachable but also rank among the most challenging. They very much want you to succeed, but will make you work for it.

In the ML courses, we covered:

* Various machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, boosting, KNN, neural networks, support vector machines, genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, gradient descent, linear regression, logistic regression.
* Markov Chains
* Pathfinding (A*)
* Data preprocessing, feature extraction, and data enrichment.
* R and python machine learning libraries (pandas, scipy, etc.)

Hopefully over the next year I will be creating posts which cover a lot of the very fun assignments we did in these machine learning courses. 

# Artificial Intelligence
My brief experience with Artificial Intelligence in this program came in the form of the wonderful A.I. For self-driving cars, taught by Sebastian Thurun (Udacity, formerly Google). We covered simultaneous localization and mapping, Kalman filters, particle filters, and used these tools to try and predict the motion of a funny little robot car.

This course planted a seed which grew into enrolling in the Udacity self-driving car nanodegree, which takes the content to a whole new level.

# Computer Vision
The Georgia Tech computer vision courses (Computational photography and Computer vision) were challenging and interesting in ways I didn't expect. They forced me to stretch my linear algebra and geometry chops. 

We covered:

* Edge detection (manual implementation of Canny and Sobel operations).
* Hough transforms for line findings.
* Feature extraction and feature matching.
* Camera calibration and undistortion.
* Epipolar geometry.
* Calculation and application of the Fundamental Matrix.
* Creating panoramas.


# What I'll miss the most
Friends. Surprisingly, I made a lot of friends in my classes. Many of us found each other in the same courses over many semesters, and ended up creating study groups. We talked on slack, shared war stories, and reveled in good grades and comforted each other in bad.

For an online program, Georgia Tech created and fostered an amazingly collaborative and and rich environments for students. Unlike other online programs, we were excited to discuss content on the forums, and the slack channels were always buzzing with conversation. 

If I ever get the chance to work with these students I industry or on research, I would jump at the opportunity.
